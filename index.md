## Benjamin's First CS193 Homework

Favorite Things about the CS193 class:
- Helpful about learning things that I didn't know about computer's and CS before
- Only an one credit course, so it is helpful without the coursework being unbearable
- Will be helpful in both future and current classes in which I need to know this material which is not covered in class
